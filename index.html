| Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions with almost one in five people experiencing one episode at some point in their lifetime {% cite bromet2011 %}. It is often debilitating and can greatly impact our and social relations, in industrialised countries depression ranks among the leading causes of disability {% cite horwitz2016 %}. Building an understanding of this disorder and how it is influenced may help reduce both its occurrence and its impact. | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/depression-bw.jpg) |  
In this website I have displayed a range of interactive visualizations of the prevalence of depressive disorders across the world. These visualizations also include visualizations for various societal factors that may contribute to the development of such disorders. The interactivity here is so you can **explore** the history of depression, and begin to form some ideas of how life events can impact your mental health.  
Like many mental health conditions, depression is complicated, it is hard to define and consequently, it is hard to understand. There will be no single metric that tells us about why someone has developed depression, rather there will be a multitude of variables beyond visualization that contribute to the condition. Thus any conclusions you may draw from these diagrams should be done with the understanding that the problem of depression is much deeper than the metrics I have chosen to plot.
