Below that is a pair of bar charts highlighting the extremes in the year 2017. This year was chosen as it is the most up-to-date records available in the source data. Finally we have a graph describing the change in depression percentages over time. This final graph may seem crowded at first but once you start focusing on a couple of countries, it will clear up. . Try pressing shift click on the map and bar chart to select multiple countries! . Grey countries signify points where data is limited . . The Change in the Population With Depressive Disorders (%) Over 27 years . Here are similar choropleth maps to the first, but now we can compare side by side the change over 27 years. Unfortunately you may be able to see that many countries have either stayed the same or gotten worse over the years. But there are some, such as Brazil and Finland that have seen dramatic changes over the years, with a now decreasing percentage of the population with depression. This begs the question, what improvements have been made in these countries over this time? .",

            "content": "Green Space Access vs Depression . Exposure to nature has long been thought to help with depression but with this choropleth diagram we can see that this does not appear to be the case at a country wide level. The positive correlation suggest that at this scale access to green space is far from a dominant metric for depression. At smaller scales, such as cities and towns, we may begin to see data that supports the classic concept of nature exposure helping to tackle depression. . Click on the country names to filter! .",

There are theories that this may be due to social pressures, resulting in men underreporting depression symptoms. However, this discussion is a deep one and is beyond the scale of this website. Papers such as Sigmon et al.’s study (2005) are a good place to start if you wish to learn more. . Shift-click to select multiple countries. . . Employment vs Depression . Working helps to give us a sense of purpose and incorporates plenty of social interaction and movement. These factors may very well link with the development of depression. This visualization plots the possible relationship between employment and depression over time. . Click on any country name to focus on that country. . When moving the year slider, it becomes clear that many countries see improvements with their employment rates over the years and at the same time, depression percentages also go down, a promising statistic. . . Satisfaction With Time Use vs Depression . Here is a simple scatter plot showing a weak positive correlation between average scores for satisfaction with time use and depression percentage. The nature of the correlation from this data does not immediately suggest a link but as the two subjects are likely related, further investigation may be needed. . . Divorce Rate vs Depression . This visualization shows divorce rate data against depression over time, a relationship that is backed here by a positive correlation. However, the points for many countries can be seen to move with no visible trend in the divorce axis. This may suggest that the correlation could be a coincidence. .
