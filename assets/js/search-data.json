The first diagram here allows you to first see the world as a choropleth of depression percentages. Below that is a pair of bar charts highlighting the extremes in the year 2017. This year was chosen as it is the most up-to-date records available in the source data. Finally we have a graph describing the change in depression percentages over time. This final graph may seem crowded at first but once you start focusing on a couple of countries, it will clear up. . Try pressing shift click on the map and bar chart to select multiple countries! . Grey countries signify points where data is limited . . The Change in the Population With Depressive Disorders (%) Over 27 years . Here are similar choropleth maps to the first, but now we can compare side by side the change over 27 years. Unfortunately you may be able to see that many countries have either stayed the same or gotten worse over the years. But there are some, such as Brazil and Finland that have seen dramatic changes over the years, with a now decreasing percentage of the population with depression. This begs the question, what improvements have been made in these countries over this time? .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
